# arduino-autoclicker

This is code for the Arduino Leonardo which extends the capabilities of a normal mouse. The Clickotron-5000 autoclicking device uses a Leonardo, a USB Host Shield board, and my custom board on top, with my code loaded on the Arduino.

The arduino can simulate mouse clicks on the computer, so other input devices can be used to create mouse clicks. For example, I use the Clickotron with two foot pedals as left and right click. The device can also continuously click the mouse buttons when the respective pedal is held down, which rests my handsâ€”I made the device because a compressed nerve was causing numbness in my hands and I had trouble using a regular mouse.
